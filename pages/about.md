# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm an experienced staff software developer based in [Ottawa, Canada](https://www.google.ca/maps/preview#!q=Ottawa%2C+ON&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d369836!2d-75.8002569!3d45.2501566!3m2!1i1382!2i790!4f13.1), seeking opportunities to contribute to
impactful projects within a forward-thinking company.

Recently at Shopify where I was hired as a senior mobile developer, I spend most of time working on their Point of Sale
application where I grew into the role of Staff Mobile Developer. After 5+ years on the team I chose to pivot to a new
role within the company. In this new role, I've spent 2+ years where I was tasked with building and maintaining tools
to load test the Shopify platform.

Before my time at Shopify, I contributed to the success of Avigilon.
During this period, I played a pivotal role in the development of their comprehensive Control Center software, covering
server-side, client-side, and mobile applications.

Throughout my experiences, I have consistently embraced opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set. Thriving
in environments that foster continuous learning and growth, I am now seeking a company that shares this commitment to
innovation. If you represent such a company, I would be thrilled if you reached out to have a conversation about how
my skill set and experiences can contribute to your organization.

For a more detailed overview of my work experience, I invite you to explore my
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/etiennemartin/). Additionally, you can find some of the small projects
I've pursued in my spare time under [projects](/projects).
